It is a chrome extension to enable a new gmail.com tab to open each time a new mail comes in. Like even u are using any other application.

                        === Phase 1 ===

To make it work. U have to follow these steps below: 
1. Open Chrome.
2. Click on the three verticle aligned dots icon on the tob right of chrome window.
3. Hover on the "More Tools" list Item in this Menu.
4. Click on Extensions. 

OR 

1. Open Chrome.
2. Write "chrome://extensions/" in chrome search bar and hit Enter button.


                        === Phase 2 ===

Please complete first phase before starting second, thanks.
1. Click on "Load unpacked" button in header ( or second header ).
2. Select Folder, this is the folder you cloned from my repo. 
3. Now open your gmail tab for once and pin this tab and continue doing ur other tasks. When a new mail will come a new gmail tab will open on chrome and u can check ur new mail and then close This newly opened Tab. 


Note: For make this extension work u have to open a new gmail tab first so that I could have an eye on it. U can Pin it and can complete ur other tasks. And if u have already opened it just give a reload and pin it. 

Alert: 
===== 
There is a big fault in here, like if u make ur pc sleep and this extension is working it is bad. Even one mail comes it will open 100's of tabs in ur chrome. So please quit chrome before give ur computer sleep. Or tuen Off this extension, before make it sleep. Thanks
